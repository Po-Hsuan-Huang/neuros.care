# Project Name: AI Yoga Assistant

## Overview
An AI-powered yoga assistant that provides real-time feedback on users' poses using a custom-trained deep learning model integrated into a full-stack web application. Designed to help users improve posture alignment and form during home workouts.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficient in **React**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for frontend development.
- Integrated a **pretrained TensorFlow.js model** for real-time pose estimation in the browser.
- Trained and fine-tuned custom **deep neural networks using TensorFlow**.
- Applied **model quantization** to reduce memory footprint and improve inference speed.
- Developed a lightweight **Flask backend** to manage model serving and API routing.
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** for seamless deployment and updates.
- Deployed a **custom AI model into production** with performance monitoring.
- Managed the **full software development lifecycle** from prototyping to deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI, Vite
- **Backend:** Flask
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, TensorFlow.js
